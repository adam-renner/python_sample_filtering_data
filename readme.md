  Project:        Identifying nonprofits within certain categories using publically available IRS tax data
  Description of script: 
                  This script uses a list of keywords in a separate file to reduce the size of the dataset and remove data that
                  is not relevant. The dataset only had limited information and, while the IRS had a search tool, it could only
                  look for one term per search. If a keyword is identified in a line from the input file, it is saved into the 
                  output file.
